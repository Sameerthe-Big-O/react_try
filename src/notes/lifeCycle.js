//*smart componet are the ones those who has state
// A component mounts when it‚Äôs added to the screen.
// A component updates when it receives new props or state, usually in response to an interaction.
// A component unmounts when it‚Äôs removed from the screen.


//*the first thing what react does is basically the mounting it's like basically does the intial setup like rendering or calling the constrctor before redering the mounting means that the react render the that component instead of the root

//*called the life Cycle hook


//*the mounting methods get triggred when the app is loaded that automatically triggredüç∂

//*the constructor get called before even the render get run and the render methods use basically to to generating the components and display the virtual dom



// The render() method is responsible for generating the component's virtual DOM representation based on its current props and state. It is called every time the component needs to be re-rendered, either because its props or state have changed, or because a parent component has been re-rendered.
